# 🎙️ Voice Bridge: AI-Powered Smart Mic for Education
**Bridging the gap between spoken lectures and digital accessibility.**

Voice Bridge is a specialized AI system designed for classroom environments. It captures a teacher's live speech via a "Smart Mic," processes it using machine learning models, and streams high-accuracy text directly to a student dashboard in real-time. This project aims to support students with hearing impairments and improve lecture retention for all learners.
